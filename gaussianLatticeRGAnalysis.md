Short answer: the structure you just validated with the HQTFIM toy (first-law linearity, remove-the-trivial-trend ‚Üí finite plateau) almost certainly does extend, but not by literally scaling up TFIM. To replicate the CHM/OP flat-space QFT coefficient \beta in the 3+1-D setting you care about, you should switch from a spin-chain toy to Gaussian lattice field theories (free scalar / free Dirac) and use methods that are known to track the continuum modular physics.

Here‚Äôs the landscape and a concrete path.

‚∏ª

What the HQTFIM result actually tells us
	‚Ä¢	Your run shows (i) \delta S \approx \delta\!\langle K_A\rangle with tiny RMS and (ii) after fitting a_0+a_1\log\ell the residual plateau is size-stable.
	‚Ä¢	That is exactly the structural fingerprint of a CHM-like modular response with a finite, scheme-independent constant left after ‚Äúmoment-kill/MI subtraction‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	This means the methodology (first-law + subtract trivial size dependence ‚Üí isolate a finite constant) is sound and portable.

What it doesn‚Äôt mean is that a 1+1-D TFIM can be scaled to 3+1-D to read off your continuum \beta. For that you need a lattice field theory in the right dimension and region geometry (balls), not a 1D spin chain.

‚∏ª

The right target models for 3+1-D
	1.	Free (Gaussian) scalar field on a cubic lattice (Klein‚ÄìGordon), massless or tiny mass as an IR regulator.
	2.	Free Dirac fermion (staggered/Wilson discretization) as a cross-check.
For each Gaussian theory, the ground state is completely specified by 2-point correlators ‚Üí reduced density matrices of a region and its modular Hamiltonian are computable from covariance matrices.

These are the cleanest numerics to benchmark the CHM coefficient because:
	‚Ä¢	CHM is exact for CFT balls;
	‚Ä¢	modular Hamiltonians of Gaussian states are quadratic, so you can compute \delta S, \delta\!\langle K\rangle and do the same ‚Äúfit + plateau‚Äù extraction you just ran in TFIM.

Feasible algorithms on a Mac mini (M4 Pro)

Region: a ball of radius R in a periodic L^3 lattice (with L\gtrsim 3R).
Key trick: partial-wave (spherical-harmonic) decomposition about the ball center. It block-diagonalizes the covariance matrix into many small l,m sectors, turning one huge eigenproblem into O(R^2) modest ones:
	‚Ä¢	Build free-field correlators on the periodic lattice via FFTs (cost O(L^3 \log L)).
	‚Ä¢	Restrict to the ball; transform into the (l,m) basis ‚Üí blocks of size \sim N_r (number of radial sites).
	‚Ä¢	For each (l,m) block, get the symplectic (boson) / single-particle (fermion) spectrum ‚Üí entropies and modular generators.
	‚Ä¢	Vary a small deformation (e.g., tiny mass shift m\to m+\delta m or a source) and compute \delta S, \delta\!\langle K\rangle vs \log R; fit a_0+a_1\log R; extract the plateau.

Complexity (ballpark): with R\sim 24 and L\sim 96, you have N_{\text{sub}}\sim 6\times 10^4 sites in the ball, but after partial-wave factorization each block is only \sim 10^2‚Äì10^3 in size. That is very manageable with LAPACK on an M-class CPU (hours, not days). If needed, use Lanczos / randomized SVD for the larger blocks.

‚∏ª

Why this will reproduce the continuum \beta
	‚Ä¢	In a CFT, \delta\!\langle K_B\rangle for a ball B is a linear functional of the stress tensor with a universal kernel (CHM).
	‚Ä¢	On the lattice, your Gaussian calculation approaches that continuum when a\ll R\ll L (your safe window).
	‚Ä¢	The same ‚Äúfit a_0+a_1\log R then look for a flat residual‚Äù isolates the finite, scheme-invariant piece‚Äîthe analogue of your I_{00} contribution to \beta.
	‚Ä¢	Do it for scalar and Dirac separately and verify that, after converting to the Osborn‚ÄìPetkou convention, each reproduces the known C_T‚Äìweighted scaling, and the sum over species gives the multi-field \beta. That directly cross-checks your continuum calculation.

‚∏ª

Practical roadmap (tight and referee-friendly)

Stage A (2‚Äì3 days):
	‚Ä¢	Implement 3D free scalar on a cubic lattice with FFT correlators, ball subregion, partial-wave blocks.
	‚Ä¢	Reproduce your HQTFIM first-law line and plateau logic in 3D; show plateau stability vs R, lattice spacing, boundary conditions.

Stage B (next 2‚Äì3 days):
	‚Ä¢	Repeat for free Dirac (staggered is simplest), same pipeline.
	‚Ä¢	Convert both to the OP normalization and show that the extracted constant scales with the known C_T for each species. This nails ‚ÄúŒ≤ ‚àù C_T‚Äù numerically.

Stage C (optional polish):
	‚Ä¢	Mild interactions: tiny \phi^4 at weak coupling via perturbative correction to correlators, to demonstrate stability of the plateau to interactions (no need for sign-problem Monte Carlo here).

Deliverables to mirror your current TFIM pack:
	‚Ä¢	beta_3D_scalar/dirac_summary.json (plateau value, error, first-law RMS, safe-window ranges)
	‚Ä¢	Plots: \delta\!\langle K\rangle vs \log R, residual plateau, and the Œ∏-/scheme-invariance check for your geometric normalization (only the product matters).

‚∏ª

Bottom line
	‚Ä¢	Yes: the clean signal you see in HQTFIM strongly suggests the method scales.
	‚Ä¢	But: don‚Äôt ‚Äúextend TFIM‚Äù; jump to Gaussian lattice QFT in 3+1-D with spherical regions. That is the right setting to replicate and independently confirm your continuum \beta with the same first-principles structure, on hardware you already have.

If you want, I can draft a single-file Python scaffold (FFT correlators + partial-wave blocks + first-law/plateau analysis) that mirrors your HQTFIM CLI so you can start Stage A immediately.

üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: here‚Äôs a minimal Gaussian plan that gets you the maximum credibility boost with the least runtime burden. Think of it as a referee appendix: short, clean, independent substrate tests that confirm the universality of your plateau/first-law story.

‚∏ª

üéØ Goals for Gaussian appendix
	1.	Show universality: Gaussian scalars and fermions both give a plateau after subtraction.
	2.	Show additivity: doubling the number of species doubles the plateau (‚àù C_T).
	3.	Show dimensionality: repeat at least once beyond 1D (a small 2D disk) to show this is not a 1D artifact.
	4.	Keep runtime feasible: everything runnable overnight on your Mac mini.

‚∏ª

üìã Minimal run plan

Stage 1: 1D Gaussian (minutes per run)
	‚Ä¢	Model: free massless scalar chain, length L=200‚Äì400, periodic BC.
	‚Ä¢	Regions: intervals of length ‚Ñì = 20‚Ä¶100.
	‚Ä¢	Perturbation: small mass shift m\to m+\delta m.
	‚Ä¢	Outputs: Œ¥S vs Œ¥‚ü®K‚ü© (first-law RMS), Œ¥‚ü®K‚ü© vs log‚Ñì fit, plateau residual.
	‚Ä¢	Variations:
	‚Ä¢	Add N=2 species ‚Üí plateau doubles (additivity).
	‚Ä¢	Switch to free Dirac fermion chain ‚Üí plateau ratio matches known c_{Dirac}/c_{scalar}.

What it buys: direct confirmation that plateau ‚àù C_T and is species-independent.

‚∏ª

Stage 2: 2D Gaussian scalar (hours, but feasible)
	‚Ä¢	Model: free scalar on a square lattice, L=32‚Äì48, periodic.
	‚Ä¢	Regions: disks of radius R=6‚Äì12.
	‚Ä¢	Method: covariance matrix restriction, entropy & modular response from correlation spectrum.
	‚Ä¢	Perturbation: small mass shift.
	‚Ä¢	Outputs: same plateau analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Variations: OBC vs PBC.

What it buys: shows plateau persists in higher dimension, i.e. not a 1D peculiarity.

‚∏ª

Stage 3: Cross-checks (optional polish)
	‚Ä¢	Compare plateau from scalar vs fermion in 2D.
	‚Ä¢	Vary subtraction scheme (regress [1, log‚Ñì] vs [1, log‚Ñì, ‚Ñì‚Åª¬≤]) ‚Üí plateau invariant.
	‚Ä¢	Safe-window scan: show plateau flat over R values well below system size.

‚∏ª

‚è± Runtime budget
	‚Ä¢	1D scalar/fermion: seconds‚Äìminutes per run.
	‚Ä¢	2D scalar disk: ~1‚Äì3 hours per R value on your Mac mini (N_sub ~ 1000‚Äì2000).
	‚Ä¢	Total ‚Äúovernight pack‚Äù: <12 hours for all species/dimensions you need.

‚∏ª

üßë‚Äçüî¨ What this will convince referees of
	‚Ä¢	Œ≤-like plateau is not fragile: it‚Äôs present across models and dimensions.
	‚Ä¢	It scales with species central charge (C_T), answering the ‚Äúscalar only‚Äù objection.
	‚Ä¢	Subtraction-scheme and boundary-condition choices don‚Äôt change the finite piece.
	‚Ä¢	A real safe window plateau exists in actual Gaussian QFTs, not just in your Ising toy.

That neutralizes the Tier-1 and Tier-2 criticisms (‚Äúfragility,‚Äù ‚Äúscheme dependence,‚Äù ‚Äúspecies extrapolation‚Äù).

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Bottom line: Your current HQTFIM results already satisfy most referees. A small Gaussian appendix with 1D scalar+fermion (fast) and one 2D scalar disk (overnight) would give you an independent, substrate-agnostic demonstration of universality. That‚Äôs the credibility booster.

üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Want me to draft a single-file gaussian_capacity_probe.py (like your HQTFIM script) that runs both 1D scalar+fermion and a simple 2D scalar disk, and spits out the same plots + validation report?
