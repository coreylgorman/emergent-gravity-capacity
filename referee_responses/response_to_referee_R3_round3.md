# Response to Referee #3 (Round 3)

**Manuscript:** *Emergent State‑Dependent Gravity from Local Information Capacity: A Conditional Thermodynamic Derivation with Cosmological Predictions*  
**Authors:** [clg]  
**Date:** August 20, 2025

Dear Referee,

Thank you for your careful, balanced reassessment of our manuscript and response. We appreciate your conclusion that the work merits **publication after minor clarifications** and your emphasis on judging the paper by the scope it explicitly claims. Below we confirm the small edits we will make to improve readability and auditability **without changing any scientific content**.

---

## 1) Scope of CGM coverage (marginal case, small‑wedge domain)

- We will insert a short **“Scope of CGM coverage”** paragraph at the end of Sec. V, making explicit that our compensator resolves the **marginal** obstruction at \(\Delta=d/2\) **within** the small‑wedge **safe window** and near‑vacuum preparation; cases with \(\Delta<d/2\) and non‑trivial one‑point deformations are outside the present scope and are flagged as environmental/subleading.  
  *Pointers in text:* Sec. V (Eqs. (11)–(16)) and the scaling remark following Eq. (13); App. H (EPMR domain statements).

## 2) Continuous‑angle invariance and table precision

- Sec. VI.C already **proves algebraically** that the observable product \(\beta f(\theta)c_{\rm geo}(\theta)\) is **independent of the cap angle** once a unit–solid–angle normalization is fixed (Eqs. (18)–(20)). We will add a **boxed corollary** immediately under Eq. (20) to highlight this result for readers scanning the section.
- In Sec. VII.B we will report \(c_{\rm geo}^{(B)}\) to **adequate precision** (rather than two‑decimal rounding) so that both scheme lines display **identical** \(\Omega_\Lambda=\beta f c_{\rm geo}\) to machine precision. This removes the cosmetic “0.0X%” mismatch that can appear when \(c_{\rm geo}^{(B)}\) is rounded to two decimals.

## 3) Operational definition of the state metric and safe‑window inequalities

- Under Eq. (5) (Sec. III.A) we will add a one‑sentence reminder that \(\sigma(x)\) is defined **operationally** as the **finite \(\ell^4\) coefficient** in the **MI‑subtracted, moment‑killed** modular response, making the regulator independence at that order explicit.
- In Sec. III.B (Eq. (6)) we will add typical orders of magnitude for the safe‑window inequalities and note that **violation of the bounds** (or failure of moment‑kill/MI cancellation) **spoils the \(\beta\) plateau**, hence falsifying the clean mapping in practice.

## 4) Convergence and stability mini‑summary

- Sec. IV.D already reports parameter/grid scans, plateau behavior (\(|\Delta\beta|/\beta\lesssim 0.5\%\)), and numerical **gates** (moment cancellations \(<10^{-20}\), positivity). We will add a 4‑line **mini‑table** in an appendix (or the main text, space permitting) with representative runs across the scan ranges to aid quick audit.

## 5) Conditionality of (A2) and falsifiers

- We will slightly strengthen the **Abstract and Conclusion** phrasing (already present) to underscore that all quantitative results are **conditional on (A2)**, and point the reader to the **falsifiers** consolidated in Sec. VIII (GW/EM luminosity‑distance ratio and bounds on \(\dot G/G\)).

## 6) Presentation polish (no technical changes)

- Minor notation/typography consistency (e.g., consistent formatting of \(f\), \(c_{\rm geo}\)).  
- A brief cross‑reference where \(a_0=\frac{\Omega_\Lambda^2}{2}cH_0\) is quoted (Sec. VII.B) to App. I, emphasizing that this weak‑field relation is an **auxiliary corollary** of the same Clausius normalization, not a phenomenological fit.

### No scientific changes

These are **clarifications only**. The **assumptions** (A1–A5 with (A2) explicitly conditional), the **marginal CGM compensator** derived via the **variational capacity closure**, the **EPMR** small‑wedge domain (flat‑space \(\ell^4\) modular coefficient; curvature at \(O(\ell^6)\)), and the **continuous‑angle invariance** of \(\beta f c_{\rm geo}\) remain exactly as in the present draft.

Thank you again for your constructive and fair evaluation. We will implement the above clarifications in the final version.

Sincerely,  
**[clg]** (for the authors)
