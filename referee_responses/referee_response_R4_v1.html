<html><head></head><body style="overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;">Grok critique (Referee 4)<div><br></div><div><div>The repository presents a theoretical framework for emergent gravity derived from finite information capacity in quantum field theory (QFT), claiming to reproduce cosmological observations like the dark energy fraction (Ω_Λ ≈ 0.685) and a MOND-like acceleration scale (a_0 ≈ 1.6 × 10^{-10} m/s²) without new parameters. However, this framework is flawed on multiple levels, from foundational assumptions to empirical predictions, rendering its claims unsubstantiated or directly contradicted by data. Below, I debunk the key components step by step, drawing on established physics and recent observational constraints.</div><div><br></div><div>### 1. **Flaws in the QFT/MI Calculation of β**</div><div>The pipeline calculates a dimensionless coefficient β ≈ 0.0209 using the Casini-Huerta-Myers (CHM) modular Hamiltonian for a ball in a 4D conformal field theory (CFT), with mutual information (MI) subtraction to remove UV divergences. This is presented as β = 2π C_T I_{00}, where C_T = 3/π⁴ ≈ 0.0308.</div><div><br></div><div>- **Non-standard value of C_T**: In standard 4D CFT literature, C_T is the central charge parameterizing the stress tensor two-point function. For a free scalar field (a baseline case), C_T is normalized to 4 in common conventions used in bootstrap and anomaly calculations. &nbsp;The claimed C_T = 3/π⁴ is orders of magnitude smaller and does not match any standard value for free fields or known CFTs (e.g., free scalar C_T = 4, fermion C_T = 6, vector C_T = 12 in the same normalization). No search for "C_T = 3/π^4 in 4d CFT" yields confirming results, suggesting this is an ad hoc or erroneous choice not grounded in established QFT.</div><div><br></div><div>- **Questionable use of MI subtraction ("moment-kill")**: MI is a valid regulator for entanglement entropy in QFT, but applying it to the modular Hamiltonian response for gravity emergence is non-standard and potentially invalid. In holographic and emergent spacetime contexts, MI defines distances or geometries, but perturbations to modular energy do not straightforwardly induce gravity without additional assumptions. Critics note that MI-based approaches can lead to inconsistencies in defining relative distances between entangled systems, especially when sectors decohere unevenly. This subtraction appears cherry-picked to yield a finite β that fits cosmology, but lacks rigorous justification for deriving state-dependent gravity.</div><div><br></div><div>Without a correct C_T or validated MI method, β is unreliable, undermining all downstream predictions (e.g., Ω_Λ = β f c_geo).</div><div><br></div><div>### 2. **Geometric Normalization and Invariant Product Issues**</div><div>The framework maps local Clausius flux to global FRW cosmology via factors f ≈ 0.8193 and c_geo = 40 (Scheme A), claiming only the product β f c_geo is physical. This is a bookkeeping convention, but:</div><div><br></div><div>- **Arbitrary schemes**: Schemes A and B yield the same product but differ internally, highlighting that the mapping is conventional rather than derived from first principles. In standard thermodynamic derivations of gravity (e.g., Jacobson's 1995 work), such normalizations are not needed because the equations emerge directly. Introducing them here suggests the framework is tuned to fit data rather than predictive.</div><div><br></div><div>- **Lack of relativistic consistency**: Emergent gravity models extending to cosmology often fail to produce a covariant, relativistic theory without introducing inconsistencies, such as non-local effects or violations of the equivalence principle. The repo's approach, relying on local information capacity, does not address how this scales to curved spacetimes without ad hoc adjustments.</div><div><br></div><div>### 3. **Cosmological Predictions Falsified by Data**</div><div>The claim that Ω_Λ = β f c_geo ≈ 0.685 matches observations without a bare cosmological constant is superficially appealing but collapses under scrutiny.</div><div><br></div><div>- **No bare Λ, but emergent DE is critiqued**: Emergent gravity theories (e.g., Verlinde's entropic gravity) attempt to derive dark energy (DE) from entanglement or information, but they fail to explain the full range of cosmological data, including CMB anisotropies, large-scale structure, and supernova distances. &nbsp;Verlinde's similar model has been shown inconsistent with galaxy cluster dynamics and lensing, requiring dark matter anyway. This framework, tying DE to QFT information capacity, inherits these issues and adds no new evidence.</div><div><br></div><div>- **Falsification via \dot{G}/G bounds**: The repo notes \dot{G}/G bounds as a falsifier. Observational constraints are extremely tight: |\dot{G}/G| &lt; 10^{-13} yr^{-1} from lunar laser ranging, &lt; 10^{-12} yr^{-1} from pulsar timing and white dwarfs, and &lt; 10^{-11} yr^{-1} from GW mergers. &nbsp; In state-dependent emergent gravity, G is effective and could vary with cosmic expansion or density, potentially exceeding these bounds. Since the manuscript claims this as a test, and no specific prediction is provided to stay within limits, the theory risks immediate falsification unless tuned unnaturally.</div><div><br></div><div>### 4. **Phenomenology (MOND-like a_0) Directly Falsified**</div><div>The weak-field prediction a_0 = (Ω_Λ² / 2) c H_0 ≈ 1.6 × 10^{-10} m/s² is claimed to match galactic rotation curves without new parameters.</div><div><br></div><div>- **MOND inconsistencies**: This is essentially a MOND-like modification (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), where gravity strengthens at low accelerations. However, MOND has been falsified by multiple datasets. Recent Gaia DR3 analysis of wide binary stars (separations &gt; 0.1 pc) shows they follow Newtonian gravity (GR), not MOND's boosted acceleration, at &gt;16σ significance. This directly contradicts the repo's a_0 scale, as wide binaries probe the exact regime where MOND (and this theory) predict deviations. &nbsp;While some studies claim support for MOND, the consensus leans toward falsification, especially in clusters and lensing where MOND underpredicts mass.</div><div><br></div><div>- **H_0 dependence issue**: The formula ties a_0 to H_0 (Hubble constant), but H_0 has a tension (67 km/s/Mpc from CMB vs. 73 from supernovae). Changing H_0 alters a_0, but observed rotation curves fix a_0 independently at ~1.2 × 10^{-10} m/s². This mismatch (repo's 1.6 × 10^{-10}) and variability falsify the parameter-free claim.</div><div><br></div><div>### 5. **GW/EM Luminosity Distance Ratio as Falsifier**</div><div>The repo lists GW/EM luminosity distance ratio as a falsifier. In GR, d_GW = d_EM, but modified gravity can introduce differences due to altered propagation (e.g., extra friction for GWs).</div><div><br></div><div>- **Tight observational constraints**: From GW170817 (binary neutron star merger with EM counterpart), |d_GW / d_EM - 1| &lt; 10^{-3} over ~40 Mpc, and broader GW catalogs constrain deviations to &lt;1% at cosmological scales. &nbsp; Emergent/MOND-like theories often predict d_GW ≠ d_EM due to effective G variations or non-luminal propagation, exceeding these bounds. &nbsp;Since this framework modifies gravity at weak fields and cosmology, it likely predicts a detectable deviation, falsifying it against LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data.</div><div><br></div><div>### Overall Conclusion: The Theory is Pseudoscientific and Falsified</div><div>This repository's claims are not supported by peer-reviewed evidence (no arXiv or journal hit for the preprint despite 2025 date), and the framework resembles critiqued emergent gravity models like Verlinde's, which fail to replace dark matter/DE while matching all data. &nbsp; The pipeline's reproducibility is irrelevant if the physics is wrong—numbers are tuned to fit (e.g., via schemes and MI subtraction), but predictions conflict with tight bounds on \dot{G}/G, GW/EM distances, and MOND falsifications from wide binaries. Standard ΛCDM with dark matter/energy remains consistent; this emergent approach does not.</div></div><div><br></div></body></html>
